## Build Dapp on top of Minswap

Minswap supports smart contract composability by passing output script address and datum hash in receiver fields of BatchOrder datum. The BatchOrder's datum needs to be hashable to the same hash that cardano-cli produces. If you use [cardano-serialization-lib](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib) to build transactions, make sure to use the latest version as that is compatible with cardano-cli.

**IMPORTANT: BatchOrder's sender cannot be script address. If an order's sender is a script address, that order can never be cancelled.**
